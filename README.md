# PostgreSQL: Students

## Creating a Students Table in PostgreSQL Database school.
This SQL query creates a new database called "school" in a PostgreSQL instance, and then creates a table called "students" in that database. 
The table contains four columns:
1.	Student_id: Each student has a unique identification that is produced automatically using the "bigserial" data type.
2.	first_name: the student's first name, saved as a variable-length string.
3.	last_name: The student's last name is saved as a variable-length string.
4.	class_id: the variable-length string containing the ID of the class to which the student belongs.
